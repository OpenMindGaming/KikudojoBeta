Hey, so first off, here is the order (from back to front) in which the things should go:
sky
back clouds
back_F
front clouds
mid_F
front_F
Secondly, I have absolutely no idea what is an optimal size for these textures. 
If you need them to be significantly smaller/larger, let me know. 
Thirdly, Kieth is a tool.
